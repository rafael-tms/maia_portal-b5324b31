I will modify `index.html` to include the Italian language option.
I realized that I was previously editing `src/App.tsx`, but the site is currently serving `index.html` directly, which is why the changes weren't appearing.

**Steps:**
1.  **Edit `index.html`**: Insert the HTML code for the Italian language option inside the `.language-selector-2` div, using a reliable external URL for the flag to ensure visibility.
